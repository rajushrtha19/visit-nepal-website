        <h3>Annapurna Circuit Trek</h3>
        <img src="./image/annapurna circuit.jpeg" align="right" width="180" height="180">
       <p align="justify"> The Annapurna Circuit Trek is one of Nepal’s most celebrated and diverse trekking routes, offering a stunning journey through the heart of the Himalayas. Circling the Annapurna Massif, this trek typically takes between 12 to 20 days, covering a distance of 160 to 230 kilometers depending on the chosen start and end points. The trail begins in lush subtropical forests and terraced farmlands, gradually ascending through alpine meadows and high mountain deserts, culminating at the challenging Thorong La Pass at an altitude of 5,416 meters. Along the way, trekkers experience a rich mix of cultures, including the Gurung, Thakali, and Manangi communities, each with unique traditions, architecture, and hospitality. Highlights of the trek include panoramic views of Annapurna I, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and Machhapuchhre, as well as visits to the sacred Muktinath Temple, the picturesque village of Manang, and the natural hot springs in Tatopani. The trek is done teahouse-style, with accommodation and meals provided in local lodges, offering a cozy and authentic Himalayan experience. The best seasons for the Annapurna Circuit are spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November), when the weather is most stable and the mountain views are at their clearest. While the trek is considered moderately challenging, it requires good physical fitness, proper acclimatization to avoid altitude sickness, and preparation for cold weather, especially at higher elevations. Permits such as the TIMS card and the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) are required for entry. Overall, the Annapurna Circuit offers an unforgettable blend of natural beauty, cultural immersion, and adventure.</p>

        <h3>Everest Base Camp Trek</h3><img src="./image/everest.jpeg" align="left" width="180" height="160">
        <p align="justify">The Everest Base Camp trek is one of the most iconic and sought-after trekking adventures in the world, taking trekkers deep into the heart of the Khumbu region of Nepal. This unforgettable journey leads to the foot of the world’s highest mountain, Mount Everest (8,848.86 meters), and typically takes around 12 to 14 days to complete. Starting with a dramatic flight into the mountain airstrip of Lukla, the trail passes through vibrant Sherpa villages such as Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, Dingboche, and Lobuche, before reaching the base camp at an elevation of 5,364 meters. Along the way, trekkers are treated to spectacular views of towering Himalayan peaks including Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam. The trek offers a deep cultural experience as well, with chances to visit ancient monasteries, interact with the warm-hearted Sherpa people, and gain insight into their Buddhist traditions. A key highlight of the trek is the hike to Kala Patthar (5,545 meters), which offers one of the best close-up views of Mount Everest. Accommodations are provided in teahouses along the trail, offering simple yet comfortable lodging and hearty local meals. The best times to undertake the Everest Base Camp trek are during spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November), when the skies are clear and the weather is relatively stable. While the trek does not require technical climbing, it demands good physical fitness and proper acclimatization to prevent altitude sickness.</p>

        <h3>Tilicho Base Camp Trek</h3><img src="./image/tilicho.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="160">
    <p align="justify">Tilicho Base Camp is a remote and scenic stopover point located in the Annapurna region of Nepal, serving as the last resting place for trekkers en route to Tilicho Lake—one of the highest lakes in the world at an altitude of 4,919 meters. Situated at approximately 4,150 meters above sea level, the base camp lies between the village of Shree Kharka and the lake itself. It is accessible via a side trail off the famous Annapurna Circuit, usually starting from the village of Manang, which is commonly used for acclimatization. The trail from Manang to Tilicho Base Camp is both beautiful and challenging, passing through rugged terrain and landslide-prone zones. The hike from Shree Kharka to the base camp takes about 3 to 4 hours, while the final push to Tilicho Lake from the base camp typically takes another 3 to 5 hours, depending on weather and fitness levels. Accommodation at Tilicho Base Camp is basic, consisting of a few simple tea houses offering meals and shared rooms, though conditions can be quite harsh due to the altitude and cold. Trekkers are advised to start their journey to the lake early in the morning to avoid strong afternoon winds and to ensure a safer return. The best time to visit is during the spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) seasons, when the weather is more stable and the views of the snow-capped peaks are at their most stunning. Proper acclimatization, warm clothing, and caution are essential when venturing to Tilicho Base Camp and beyond.</p>
