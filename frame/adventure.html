                Paragliding in Nepal is an exhilarating adventure sport that offers a unique way to experience the country's breathtaking natural beauty. Among the most popular destinations for paragliding is Pokhara, a scenic lakeside city surrounded by the Annapurna mountain range. The experience typically begins from Sarangkot Hill, located about 1,600 meters above sea level, which provides a perfect take-off point with panoramic views of the Himalayas, including peaks like Machhapuchhre (Fishtail), Dhaulagiri, and Annapurna. From the air, paragliders soar over lush valleys, tranquil Phewa Lake, and picturesque villages.
                Nepal offers both tandem flights—ideal for beginners with no prior experience—and courses for those interested in learning to fly solo. Tandem paragliding involves flying with an experienced pilot, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the ride. The flight duration usually ranges from 20 to 30 minutes, though longer "cross-country" flights are also available for the more adventurous.
                Other paragliding spots in Nepal include Bandipur, Sirkot, and Kathmandu Valley, but Pokhara remains the top choice due to its reliable weather conditions, stunning views, and well-established infrastructure.

        <h4>Bungee Jump</h4>
        <img src="./image/bungee.jpg" align="left" widht="160" height="160">
        <p align="justify">Bungee jumping in Nepal is an adrenaline-packed adventure that combines heart-stopping excitement with stunning natural scenery. Nepal offers some of the most thrilling bungee jump experiences in the world, thanks to its deep gorges, fast-flowing rivers, and dramatic landscapes.
            The most famous bungee jump spot is at The Last Resort, located near the Nepal-Tibet border, about a 3-hour drive from Kathmandu. This site features a 160-meter (525 feet) drop over the Bhote Koshi River, one of the wildest rivers in Nepal. The jump takes place from a suspension bridge designed specifically for bungee jumping, surrounded by lush hills and rugged cliffs, making it one of the highest commercial bungee jumps in the world.
            Another exciting location is in Pokhara, at the Hemja Bungee Jump, which offers a 70-meter vertical drop from a tower platform. While not as high as The Last Resort, the jump in Pokhara provides a stunning view of the Annapurna mountain range and is easily accessible for travelers already visiting the city for other adventure sports like paragliding or zip-lining.</p>
