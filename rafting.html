      Nepal is home to eight out of the fourteen highest peaks in the world with cultures ranging colorful and intricate Hindus religion to the austerity of the Buddhist monasteries. From the breathtaking heights of the Himalayas the rivers crash down through the foothills, fed by monsoon rains and melting snow, on their way to the Great Plains of the Ganges.
      Our mountains, Rivers and everything inbetween creates a wealth of unlimited world class opportunities for great river rafting, kayaking, climbing, mountaineering, biking, hiking and the ever popular trekking adventures in Nepal. Nepal has something to offer to everyone.

      We are proud to share our wonderful country, culture and our many years of experience adventuring across Nepal with you. We offer unique opportunity to explore Nepal’s remote  countryside from the river.
