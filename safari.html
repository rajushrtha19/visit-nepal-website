        <img src="./image/chitwan jungle safari.jpg" align="right" width="190" height="180">
        <p align="justify">Chitwan Jungle Safari is one of Nepal’s most popular wildlife experiences, set in the heart of Chitwan National Park—a UNESCO World Heritage Site covering 932 square kilometers in the Terai lowlands. The park is known for its incredible biodiversity, home to over 700 species of wildlife and more than 500 species of birds. Among its most iconic inhabitants are the endangered one-horned rhinoceros, Royal Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, sloth bear, and gharial crocodile. A variety of safari activities are available to visitors, including jeep safaris that venture deep into the jungle, elephant-back rides offering a unique vantage point, canoeing along the serene Rapti River, and guided jungle walks for up-close exploration of the flora and fauna. Birdwatching is especially rewarding here due to the rich avian diversity. Cultural experiences such as the Tharu cultural dance show and visits to the Tharu village give insight into the lives of the indigenous Tharu people. Many tour packages offer 2- to 4-day stays that include safaris, accommodation, meals, and guided activities. Access to Chitwan is convenient from Kathmandu, either by tourist bus, private car, or a short flight to Bharatpur followed by a drive. Whether you're looking for a rugged adventure or a more luxurious escape into the wild, Chitwan Jungle Safari offers something for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Bardiya Jungle Safari</h3>
        <img src="./image/bardiya safari.jpeg" align="left" width="190" height="180">
        <p align="justify">Situated in the mid far western Terai, in a remote part of Nepal, bordered by the Karnali River, the National Park covers 968 sq. km. It is 585 km from Kathmandu. The park is the largest and most undisturbed expanse of wilderness in southern Nepal. Although the largest park it is least explored by foreign tourists.
            About 70% of the park is covered with Sal jungle, the remaining 30% is a mixture of grassland, savannah and riverine forest. The park contains eight types of ecosystem. The park headquarters are situated at Thakurdwara (also the location of Forest Hideaway) and is surrounded by idyllic villages and fields inhabited by an indigenous ethnic group, the ‘Tharu’.
            Originally a hunting reserve, Bardia became a conservation area in 1976 and then attained National Park status in 1988. Presently a plan is being considered to further expand the park both north and eastwards. Conservation is a strong theme within Bardia; the park as well providing a home habitat for many species also provides an ideal environment for the study of wildlife. The WWF and the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation are active in the park monitoring wildlife and breeding habitats. They have also implemented an educational scheme for local people identifying the meaning of, and need for conservation.</p>
